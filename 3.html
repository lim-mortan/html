<p>Java (Indonesian: Jawa, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈdʒawa]; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is one of the islands of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea on the north. With a population of 147.7 million (Java only) or 151.8 million (including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands, principally Madura), Java constitutes 56.1 percent of the Indonesian population and is the world's most-populous major island.[1] The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is on its northwestern coast. Much of the well-known part of Indonesian history took place on Java.
